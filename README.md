# MileStone-Project-My-first-Game
My game is called Jack's Adventure and this game is inspired by that offline Google game with the dinosaur jumping over the cactus. Was inspired to make this game because I would always play it on the school laptop during high school when I got bored of class. The controls are very basic being a click on the mouse to jump. Their would be an obstacle that you would have to jump and you would get more points the longer you survive. I used the basic three coding being HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Their was one bug that I truly didn't understand why It was happening and it was that it wouldn't reload the page correctly after reloading the page automatically. I truly wanted to use Javascript as the main source as the movement but I was struggling with understanding the code. So I continued using key frames instead.
